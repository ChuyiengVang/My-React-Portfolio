        Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, 
        but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, 
        but that's not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?

        Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. 
        This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. 
        He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he 
        thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the 
        engine didn't make a sound.
